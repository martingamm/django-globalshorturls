django-globalshorturls
======================

An app for the django framework that simplifies the task of shortening any URL to an URL of the form yourdomain.com/XYZ.
It supports very basic stats (how many has visited the link), as well as a simple interface for adding new URLs.

If you only need to support shortening of local urls (to articles on your own site for example), I recommend using django-shorturls instead, that can be found here: https://github.com/jacobian/django-shorturls. The baseconv.py file in globalshorturls is borrowed from that app.
