## django-globalshorturls ##

An app for the django framework that simplifies the task of shortening any URL to an URL of the form yourdomain.com/XYZ
It supports very basic stats (how many has visited the link), as well as a simple interface for adding new URLs.

If you only need to support shortening of local urls (to articles on your own site for example), I recommend using django-shorturls instead, that can be found [here](https://github.com/jacobian/django-shorturls). The baseconv.py file in globalshorturls is borrowed from that app.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on my twitter, [@martingamm](http://twitter.com/martingamm).

Patches are welcome!
